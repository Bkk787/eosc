	Use:   "undelegatebw [from] [receiver] [network bw unstake qty] [cpu bw unstake qty]",
	Short: "Undelegate some CPU and Network bandwidth.",
	Long: `Undelegate some CPU and Network bandwidth.

When undelegating bandwidth, a "refund" action will automatically be
triggered and delayed for 72 hours.  This means it takes 3 days for
you to get your EOS back and being able to transfer it. However, your
voting power is immediately altered.
