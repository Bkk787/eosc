-----------------------------

We generated help based on the `eosc` output, and produce
`generated_help.json` under `/data`.

---

.Data["eosc-tools-chain-freeze"]["short"]

```
{{ if $parent := .Data["eosc-tools-chain-freeze"]["parent"]; $parent }}
{{ with .Data[$parent]["persistent_flags"] }}Parent flags:
{{ . }}{{ end }}
{{ end }}
```

Shortcode `generated_help` that reads the `eosccommand` from the article, and produces
output based on the `data/generatedhelp.json` file.

Articles' manifest would include:

```
...
title: ...

eosccommand: eosc-tools

{% generated_help  %}
