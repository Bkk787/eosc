With many new and exciting things happening on the EOS mainnet, we at EOS Canada wanted to make sure that you could use `eosc` to handle
all of your development needs. 

Here's a list of some of the more recent additions to `eosc` that will help to save you time and enhance your EOS experience:

* Updated to the latest version of eos-go
* Added long descriptions to all commands to help with ease of use when discovering new commands
* Fully supports all actions with the Resource Exchange (REX) that was recently added to the EOS mainnet and BOSCORE network
* Added validation on `updateauth` and `newaccount` actions to catch common unrecoverable errors or omissions from being pushed to the blockchain
* `eosc tools names` now accepts multiple values to output multiple responses with a single command

We are constantly looking for feedback for what features and tools you would like to have available to build dapps on EOS. 
Please feel free to fork and contribute, and reach out to us in our [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/eoscanada). 
We look forward to building up the developer toolkit for EOS with the community, and for the community.
