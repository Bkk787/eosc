Since before the launch of the EOS mainnet, EOS Canada has been developing eosc - the most flexible and powerful command line tool for any developer to interact with an EOSIO chain. eosc integrates the functionalities of both `cleos` and `keosd`, as well as offering extra features for EOS users.

On September 21st, the official v1.0.0 of eosc was released on our GitHub repository. We wanted to take a moment to highlight some of the features that you would have access to when using eosc.

* Complete parity with `cleos`
* Operates on all major platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux
* Integration with Referendum Contract that EOS Canada has been leading the way in coding for the EOS community
* Easy offline signing of transactions and storing of private keys for the highest level of security
* Ability to recast and cancel all votes for Block Producers or a proxy in a single command

We are constantly looking for feedback for what features and tools you would like to have available to you. Please feel free to reach out to us in our Telegram Channel and chat with us, or open an Issue on GitHub. We look forward to building up the developer toolkit for EOS with the community, and for the community.
