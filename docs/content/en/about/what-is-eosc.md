eosc is a multi-platform command line development tool for securely storing your private keys and interacting with any EOSIO
blockchain quickly, efficiently, and with greater functionality than any other tool currently available.

EOS Canada is always looking towards the developer community to find out what functions and features they need to quickly integrate those into eosc. We believe strongly in the power of creating single commands to perform complex transactions. This will increase the speed of anyone using eosc so that they can focus on their projects, rather than on how they interact with the blockchain.

eosc is intended to be used by any developer who wants to interact with an EOSIO blockchain
